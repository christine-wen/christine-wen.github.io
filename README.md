Hi! It's a work in progress but check out my website [here](https://christine-wen.github.io)

## Why did I make this?
I'm always interested in learning new things and after learning more about coding from my courses in university, I thought what better way to learn new things while combining some coding concepts in class than to make my own website?

I felt like I couldn't talk about everything I wanted to on a one-page resume, so this is an outlet for me to do that!

## Ideas for future
I don't think I'm finished the website and I might never be because I'm always learning new things. As I continue doing projects and gaining more experiences, I will keep updating my website accordingly. However, here are some ideas I'd love to implement in the future
* More pages for projects, interests, etc.
* Changing the navigation menu to a horizontal bar for easier access
* More cool effects on buttons/links

## Acknowledgements
I've learned a lot about web design but always give credit where credit is due
